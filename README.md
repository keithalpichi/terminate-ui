# Terminate   
---
#### Theme for the Atom.io editor

> Terminate-ui (this package) goes really well with Terminate-syntax. Make sure to pair these together.

A theme inspired by Apple's green default Terminal profile with contrasting colors to highlight important components of the UI.

## Idea behind Terminate:
- Old school feel of bright green font with a dark background.
- Contrasting colors to highlight git changes, active elements, folders and files.
 - Colors in file tree represent changes in files
 - Active/selected elements are bright neon green
- Some simple shadow affects to bring energy to the editor
- Theme made to match with `Terminate-syntax` (make sure to pair these together)
